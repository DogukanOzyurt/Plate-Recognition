#License Plate Recognition using Image Processing and Keras OCR
This project is developed for license plate detection and recognition from an image using various image processing techniques and the Keras OCR library.

Features
Image Processing Techniques:

Applies different image processing methods to improve the visibility of license plates in images.
Implements techniques such as thresholding, edge detection, and contour analysis for efficient plate localization.
Keras OCR Library:

Integrates the Keras OCR library to perform Optical Character Recognition (OCR) on the identified license plates.
Utilizes deep learning models for accurate character recognition.
